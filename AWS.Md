# AWS Basics

## Introduction

This README provides an overview of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and its significance in the cloud computing industry.

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is defined as the use of hosted services, such as data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software over the internet.

The data is stored on physical servers, which are maintained by a cloud service provider. 

Computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, are available on-demand, without direct management by the user in cloud computing.

**Definition:** Cloud computing is like renting resources, such as storage space or computing power, over the internet instead of owning them outright. Instead of buying and maintaining physical servers or other infrastructure, you can access these resources as needed from a cloud service provider.

**Characteristics of cloud computing:**
1. **On-demand self-service:** Users can provision and manage computing resources without human intervention from the service provider.
2. **Broad network access:** Cloud services are accessible over the internet from various devices such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets.
3. **Resource pooling:** Resources are shared among multiple users, allowing for efficient use and optimization of infrastructure.
4. **Rapid elasticity:** Resources can be scaled up or down quickly to meet changing demands.
5. **Measured service:** Cloud service usage is monitored, controlled, and billed based on consumption.

**Types of cloud services:**
1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking.
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Offers a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without worrying about underlying infrastructure.
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis, eliminating the need for users to install, maintain, and update the software locally.

## What is AWS?

** Amazon Web Services (AWS) is an on-demand cloud computing solution provided by Amazon, which includes 200+ services, platforms, and application programming interfaces

**Overview:** AWS is a comprehensive cloud computing platform offered by Amazon.com. It provides a wide range of services, including computing power, storage, databases, machine learning, analytics, and more. These services are available on a pay-as-you-go basis, meaning you only pay for what you use without any long-term contracts.

**History and background:** AWS was officially launched in 2006, although Amazon had been using its own infrastructure for years prior. Initially, AWS offered basic computing and storage services, but it quickly expanded to include a vast array of services to meet the needs of businesses of all sizes.

**Market share and significance:** AWS is one of the leading cloud service providers globally, with a significant market share. Its dominance in the cloud computing industry is attributed to its extensive range of services, reliability, scalability, security, and cost-effectiveness. Many businesses, from startups to Fortune 500 companies, rely on AWS for their cloud computing needs, making it a key player in shaping the future of technology infrastructure.

## Advantages of AWS

1. **Scalability:** AWS offers the ability to scale resources based on demand, allowing businesses to handle fluctuating workloads effectively.

2. **Flexibility:** With a wide range of services, AWS caters to various needs, from simple storage solutions to complex machine learning algorithms.

3. **Cost-effectiveness:** AWS follows a pay-as-you-go pricing model, where users only pay for the resources they use, without any upfront costs or long-term commitments.

4. **Reliability:** AWS provides high availability and fault tolerance, ensuring that services are accessible and reliable, even in the event of failures or outages.

5. **Security:** AWS offers robust security features and compliance certifications, ensuring data privacy, integrity, and protection against unauthorized access.
